📊 "Smart Startup Pitch Generator"
An AI web app that helps entrepreneurs automatically generate investor-ready startup pitches, using AI + their own input documents.

🧠 Project Summary:
Users upload their startup idea (as a doc or brief) → AI reads it → suggests improvements → generates an investor pitch deck + structured pitch format + startup summary + even generates FAQs from it.

✅ How it Covers All 4 Concepts:
Feature	Implementation
🧠 Prompting	Prompt the LLM as: “You are a startup mentor and investor. Provide constructive feedback on the user’s idea, generate a 1-minute pitch and a SWOT analysis.”
📚 RAG	Retrieve content from uploaded business plans, pitch decks, industry benchmarks (PDFs, DOCs)
📦 Structured Output	Return data like: { "Problem": ..., "Solution": ..., "Target Market": ..., "SWOT": { ... } }
🔌 Function Calling	Trigger tools like: generatePitchDeck(slideCount), summarizeIdea(), createPitchVideo(script)

🧾 Example User Flow:
User uploads a 2-page business idea document.
