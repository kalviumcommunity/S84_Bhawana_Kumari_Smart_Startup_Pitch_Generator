📊 "Smart Startup Pitch Generator"
An AI web app that helps entrepreneurs automatically generate investor-ready startup pitches, using AI + their own input documents.

🧠 Project Summary:
Users upload their startup idea (as a doc or brief) → AI reads it → suggests improvements → generates an investor pitch deck + structured pitch format + startup summary + even generates FAQs from it.

✅ How it Covers All 4 Concepts:
Feature	Implementation
🧠 Prompting	Prompt the LLM as: “You are a startup mentor and investor. Provide constructive feedback on the user’s idea, generate a 1-minute pitch and a SWOT analysis.”
📚 RAG	Retrieve content from uploaded business plans, pitch decks, industry benchmarks (PDFs, DOCs)
📦 Structured Output	Return data like: { "Problem": ..., "Solution": ..., "Target Market": ..., "SWOT": { ... } }
🔌 Function Calling	Trigger tools like: generatePitchDeck(slideCount), summarizeIdea(), createPitchVideo(script)

🚀 Key Features
📄 Upload Business Idea: Users can submit their startup briefs or business plans as text or PDF.

🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): The app intelligently pulls relevant insights from uploaded files and background data to improve the pitch.

🧠 Smart Prompting: Role-based prompts simulate an expert startup mentor to guide and refine the pitch.

📦 Structured Output: Returns a clean JSON or visual format for key pitch sections — Problem, Solution, Market, etc.

🔌 Function Calling: Includes custom actions like generatePitchDeck(), summarizeIdea(), and createSWOT() to automate content generation.

📤 Export Options: Users can download the pitch deck outline or save structured content for further editing.

🧾 Example User Flow:
User uploads a 2-page business idea document.

RAG searches relevant parts + market research PDFs.

AI uses prompting to critique and improve it.

Generates:

A one-minute elevator pitch

A 5-slide pitch deck outline

A SWOT analysis (in structured JSON)

Calls generatePDF() function to export a pitch deck.

🧑‍💼 Real-World Use Cases:
💼 Aspiring founders & entrepreneurs

🎓 Students in startup incubation programs

🚀 Hackathon or startup pitch participants

🧰 Tech Stack
Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js + Express

LLM API: OpenAI GPT-4 (with function calling and structured output)

RAG Layer: LangChain + ChromaDB or Pinecone

Authentication: (Optional) Firebase Auth or JWT

File Parsing: pdf-parse, docx-parser (optional)

💡 Bonus Ideas:
Integrate AI voice to read the pitch (using ElevenLabs)

Add "investor review simulation" with scoring

Track progress or store previous versions

## Zero-Shot Prompting in Smart Startup Pitch Generator

Zero-Shot Prompting allows the AI to generate high-quality outputs without training examples, using only a well-crafted prompt.

### How it works in this project:
1. User enters a startup idea.
2. The prompt tells the AI exactly what sections to include in the pitch.
3. AI generates a full business pitch instantly.

### Run it:
```bash
node zeroShotPitch.python

🔥 Temperature Parameter in the Project

In this project, we use the temperature parameter when generating startup pitches with the LLaMA model.

What is Temperature?

The temperature controls the creativity vs. determinism of the AI’s responses:

Low values (0.0 – 0.3):

More focused and deterministic output.

The AI will pick the most likely words, leading to precise, predictable responses.

Best for factual, technical, or professional explanations.

Medium values (0.5 – 0.7):

A balance between creativity and reliability.

Generates slightly varied responses while staying relevant.

Best for pitches, feedback, and analyses (this is what we use in the project).

High values (0.8 – 1.0+):

Very creative and diverse output.

Responses may be less predictable, sometimes even off-topic.

Useful for brainstorming ideas or exploring innovative angles.
